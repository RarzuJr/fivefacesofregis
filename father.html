                    <p class="card-text">Hello, world! I am Regis the Father, Regis the Husband, Regis, the Family man.
                        I was raised in New York City and currently reside in Colorado. At the end of 2010, I received
                        this calling to pack my things and move to Colorado. I didn't know anyone in Colorado at the
                        time, my life was pretty good in New York, and I was not unhappy, but I knew something was
                        missing in my life, and it was in Colorado.</p>

                    <p> Fast forward eight years later, I am married to the most amazing supportive wife, and I have the
                        coolest son in the world, and they both power me to strive and push to be more successful than I
                        have ever been. Going from being this poor black boy who grew up in the Bronx projects to
                        purchasing my third home in Colorado, I can only credit my family for being there through thick
                        and thin. My superhero powers are unlimited with them by my side, and as long as I have them,
                        this is the core of who I am. .</p>
